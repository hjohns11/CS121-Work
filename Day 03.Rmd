# Strings, Numbers, and collections

Funny things happen when you construct things
* The quotes are a signal to the interpreter, not part of the string itself
* To put in quotes, escape them
* Things like cat('\n') indicate "control characters"



The President is
```{r}
myFavName <- "Vlad"
```

```r
cat("the fog came in \n on the town.")
```

```
## the fog came in 
##  on the town.
```



```r
plot(1:50)
```
